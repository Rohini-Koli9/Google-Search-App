The **Google Search App** is a simple web application built using React.js and Tailwind CSS. It functions as a basic Google search engine, utilizing an API to display search results in both the image and text sections. The app also incorporates a secret API key for its functionality.

## Features

- **Search**: Perform Google searches directly from the app.
- **Search Results**: View search results, including web pages, images, and news articles.
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive and minimalistic design for a seamless user experience.
- **Responsive**: The app is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Customization**: Personalize your search experience with various settings and filters.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up a local development environment and get the project running on your machine.
